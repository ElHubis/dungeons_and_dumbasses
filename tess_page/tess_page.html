    <h1>
        Tess, Conqurer of Femboys, Slayer of Evil
    </h1> 
    <P>
        I got captured into a mental asylum because of severe alcohol and drug abuse. As well as a few crimes such as: <br>
        - Attempt at robbing a person <br>
        - Attempt at robbing an explosives shop <br>
        - Attempt at pick-pocketing <br>
        - Attempt at stealing a nobles crown <br>
        - Drunk horseback-riding <br>
        - Arson (multiple occasions) <br>
        - Destruction of private property <br>
        - Destruction of communal property <br>
        As you can maybe tell I am not very good at anything except destroying and putting things on fire. Though I am a mavster at riding horses while drunk. Anyways, how did I escape this mental asylum? Well, they put a dog mouth cage (note: I AM NOT A DOG) over my mouth to make me not explode the asylum walls. I kinda understand the reasoning behind that but I still don't like it. Okay so how did I escape? well there was this really rude woman that is called Dr. Hue and she was supposed to help me feel better but she just called me names and said "Dumb, dumb dragon. Stupid dragon." (I am not stupid) she also hurt me a lot and put me in this weird jacket where I couldn't move sometimes. She also used her magic powers to freeze me and make me super cold. (not cool). I dont remember much more but she probably did other really rude stuff. <br>
        I ended up escaping by putting the lock from my mouth cage in my mouth without them noticing and heating up my mouth enough for it to melt. I don't know why I didn't do it earlier but I probably had a really good reason. I then pretended nothing happened so I wouldn't alert the guards and then I ROCKET JUMPED out of the asylum court yard without anyone noticing (I think) and ran away to the forest and now I kinda just ended up here with a buff cat, an impostor and the guy from terminator.
