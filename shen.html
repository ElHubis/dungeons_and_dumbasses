            "Square Up"
        </h2>

        <p>
            Cheesecake told the shopkeeper to square up which resulted in a 
            imagination duel with both sides getting some clean hits in. 
            Cheesecake dealt som big damage by using the Shakira and J.Lo
            superbowl halftime show performance, but in the end, the 
            shopkeeper unfortunately won by conjuring 15 tons of catnip.

        <p>
            Dessesus, Tess and Cheesecake decide to try and tame two undead warhorses despite Arnolds multiple attemps at convincing them not to. The horses start sinking into the ground with Cheesecake on one of them. Cheesecake of course instantly jumps off but Tess tries to Step on one of them which makes her leg get stuck and dragged underground. This ends with Tess' leg getting cut off at the hip leaving them one legged.
