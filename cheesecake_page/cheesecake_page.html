    <P>
        Decessus lived as a child with their mother and little sister in a tiny shack on the outskirts of a small village where they were completely shielded. They weren't allowed outside when the sun was up and were just told it was because of “monsters”.Decessus grew up seeking comfort by the forest just outside the gates when being stuck in a room with their family was too much, and one day someone else was there. They quickly became friends and would spend many nights together watching the stars while laying on the grass, but they never did anything else, Decessus had never even seen them outside of the forest. After Decessus turned 15, a few years later, they started to feel more and more confined by the small space and started to occasionally leave the shed during the day. One day when their sister woke up in ruins after losing her locket, they decided to look for it. Decessus found it fairly quickly but decided to roam around the village some more, and eventually stumbled upon the town square where they could see their friend standing next to a few well dressed people, all with their backs turned. Decessus decided to approach them and tapped their shoulder with a greeting earning the attention of the surrounding party but was met with threatening words and stances. To escape the dangerous situation Decessus ran home accidentally revealing their shack. When the night came around everything was silent and sleep fell over the town only to be interrupted by giant flames and thick smoke. Decessus woke up only to realise their family was already dead, so they decided to run wherever their legs took them. Out of breath they were standing face to face with their friend in the forest. Even though their friend was pleading for forgiveness, Decessus lost control and blacked out, only to return to consciousness under a giant old oak tree with blood on their clothes and a locket tightly secured in their palm. Guilt and regret spread faster than the tears already falling from their face as they knew they had just lost it all, their home, their friend, their family, their innocence. <br>
        
        Becomes an adventurer after fires mysteriously started to spread in the forest to find out why.
