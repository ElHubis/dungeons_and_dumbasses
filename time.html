            Tess and Cheesecake wake up in a prison cell that they pick the lock on and get out, when outside a Skeleton warrior notices their attempt at escaping and tries to stop them. It was a fearsome fight with it getting a few bad hits in, but in the end Tess and Cheesecake won. Meanwhile Dessesus and Arnold gets to the house where Tess and Cheesecake are being kept. Upfront are two skeletons on warhorses, meaning they can't come in through there. Instead they break in through a back window as the fight with Tess and Cheesecake is happening and see more guards inside. Arnold obliterates an unknowing guard shooting him in the head so hard he flies through a window. This alerts the other guards and a large fight breaks out. As a two of the guards die, parts of the building dissapates with them. This is utterly confusing and the party attributes this to life forms and inanimate objects being able to have soul-bonds.

            Coming back outside they see the warhorses. Cheesecake, Tess and Dessesus try to convince Arnold that trying to tame them would be a good idea because they can later sell the horses to Fortunes favors. Arnold disagrees, not backing down from his opinion. As Tess and Cheesecake try to tame one of the borses (bone-horses) it starts sinking to the ground. Cheesecake jumps off but Tess tries to step on the borses head. The borse grabs a hold of Tess' foot and drags it underground. As Tess is slowly being dragged down they grab a hold of Cheesecake. Cheesecake tries to get out of Tess' grip. He promises Tess that he will help them if he gets let loose. Before Cheesecake can do anything Arnold comes and chops Tess' leg clean off by the hip, letting them free from the borse's hold. In the end everyone makes it out alive, except for Tess' leg of course and Cheesecakes' trust for Tess.

            Arnold takes out his compass, looking after the closest opening to Fortunes favors so he can carry Tess there and get a new prosthetic leg. The party finds it in a tavern after signing their middle names on a piece of paper to get in (Dessesus and Cheesecake are sceptical, but Cheesecake finally complies after Arnold and Tess need Cheesecakes assistance, though Dessesus remained outside.) Cheesecake ends up ranting about his life to the bartender on the way, being very upset about this whole predicament. The conversation finishes with the bartender giving Cheesecake the finest flour in all the country, taking him one step closer to his ultimate goal.

            After a long conversation with Shopkeeper the shopkeeper, Tess, Arnold and Cheesecake end up with the deal that Tess will get a new leg, designed to their hearts content, for the price of 2 shortswords, 4 poision vials, 2 severed heads and 14 revigorating cookies. This concludes the session with Tess' player having to design their own new leg, and Dessesus waiting outside.
