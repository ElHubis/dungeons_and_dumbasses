    <h1>
        Arnold
    </h1> 
    <P>
        Saved a town by defeating a demon that cast a curse on Aseir that slowly turned him into a tefling. The town folk was first very thankful but as Aseir turned into a tefling the towns people became more and more hateful, eventually chasing Aseir away, abandoning him. Aseir became a mercenary and worked for a warlord that ruled over the town he saved. The town had gotten help from a neighboring country and started a rebellion. Aseir was dispatched to deal with this rebelion. He murdered every single person in the town, even the women and children. Then standing in a pudel of blood and water he sees his reflection, but the face he sees isn't a half demon half human face it is his old face. The one he had before the demon cursed him.
