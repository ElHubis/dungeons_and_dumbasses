    <h1>
        Decessus
    </h1> 
    <P>
        Decessus lived as a child with their mother and little sister in a tiny shack on 
        the outskirts of a small village where they were completely shielded. They weren’t 
        allowed outside when the sun was up and were just told it was because of “monsters”.
        Decessus grew up seeking comfort by the forest just outside the gates when being 
        stuck in a room with their family was too much, and one day someone else was 
        there. They quickly became friends and would spend many nights together watching 
        the stars while laying on the grass, but they never did anything else, Decessus 
        had never even seen them outside of the forest. After Decessus turned 15, a few years 
        later, they started to feel more and more confined by the small space and started to 
        occasionally leave the shed during the day. One day when their sister woke up in 
        ruins after losing her locket, they decided to look for it. Decessus found it fairly 
        quickly but decided to roam around the village some more, and eventually stumbled 
        upon the town square where they could see their friend standing next to a few well 
        dressed people, all with their backs turned. Decessus decided to approach them and 
        tapped their shoulder with a greeting earning the attention of the surrounding party 
        but was met with threatening words and stances. To escape the dangerous situation 
        Decessus ran home accidentally revealing their shack. When the night came around 
        everything was silent and sleep fell over the town only to be interrupted by giant 
        flames and thick smoke. Decessus woke up only to realise their family was already 
        dead, so they decided to run wherever their legs took them. Out of breath they were 
        standing face to face with their friend in the forest. Even though their friend was 
        pleading for forgiveness, Decessus lost control and blacked out, only to return to 
        consciousness under a giant old oak tree with blood on their clothes and a locket 
        tightly secured in their palm. Guilt and regret spread faster than the tears already 
        falling from their face as they knew they had just lost it all, their home, their 
        friend, their family, their innocence. <br>
        
        Becomes an adventurer after fires mysteriously started to spread in the forest to find out why.
